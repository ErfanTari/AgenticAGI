# CLAUDE.md — Agent Platform Architecture Guide

This file defines the architecture, memory system, and build philosophy for this agent platform.
Read this fully before writing any code. Every decision here exists for a reason.

---

## What We Are Building

A local-first AI agent platform with a structured memory system.
The goal: an agent that feels like a knowledgeable human assistant —
not a search engine that forgets everything between sessions.

The agent must:
- Remember people, projects, plans, and procedures across sessions
- Fetch only what it needs (never dump everything into context)
- Connect pieces of knowledge to each other meaningfully
- Think in the background when idle
- Respond fast on simple queries, deep on complex ones

---

## Core Philosophy

**Simplicity over cleverness.** Every layer must earn its place.
If a feature adds complexity without clear benefit, do not build it yet.

**Index first, fetch second, search last.**
The agent should almost never need to search memory for known things.
Search is the last resort, not the default.

**Files are truth. SQLite is the map.**
All real content lives in markdown files.
SQLite holds only what is needed to find and connect those files.
Never duplicate content between them.

**Codes are the universal language.**
Every memory entry has a code. That code is readable by humans and machines.
It tells you the notebook, the type, and the number — without opening anything.

## The Code System

Every memory entry has a universal code. Format:

```
[NOTEBOOK].[TYPE]-[NUMBER]

Examples:
WHO.CT-0024     → Contact number 24
WHAT.PJ-0003    → Project number 3
WHEN.CA-0118    → Calendar event 118
HOW.PR-0012     → Procedure number 12
WHY.QU-0013     → Open question 13
WHY.MT-0004     → Meta reflection 4
NOW.TD-0041     → Todo item 41
PLAN.PL-0007    → Planning entry 7
```

### Type Reference

| Notebook | Type Code | Meaning         |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| WHO      | CT        | Contact         |
| WHO      | ORG       | Organization    |
| WHAT     | PJ        | Project         |
| WHAT     | KN        | Knowledge entry |
| WHEN     | CA        | Calendar event  |
| WHEN     | DL        | Deadline        |
| HOW      | PR        | Procedure       |
| WHY      | MT        | Meta reflection |
| WHY      | QU        | Open question   |
| NOW      | TD        | Todo item       |
| NOW      | RP        | Report          |
| PLAN     | PL        | Planning entry  |

### Rules for codes
- Codes are generated sequentially and never reused
- Codes are written into both the markdown file header AND SQLite
- When an agent writes a markdown file referencing another entry, it uses the code inline
- Codes in markdown content act as live references — always fetchable

---

## SQLite Schema

Two tables. Nothing more until justified.

### Table: index_entries

```sql
CREATE TABLE index_entries (
  code      TEXT PRIMARY KEY,   -- e.g. WHO.CT-0024
  nb        TEXT NOT NULL,      -- e.g. WHO  (indexed for fast filter)
  type      TEXT NOT NULL,      -- e.g. CT   (indexed for fast filter)
  name      TEXT NOT NULL,      -- human readable name
  status    TEXT NOT NULL,      -- active | archived | open | closed | upcoming
  updated   TEXT NOT NULL,      -- ISO date string
  summary   TEXT,               -- one line, agent answers simple queries from this
  path      TEXT NOT NULL       -- full path to markdown file
);

CREATE INDEX idx_nb     ON index_entries(nb);
CREATE INDEX idx_type   ON index_entries(type);
CREATE INDEX idx_status ON index_entries(status);
```

### Table: relationships

```sql
CREATE TABLE relationships (
  from_code  TEXT NOT NULL,   -- e.g. WHO.CT-0025
  relation   TEXT NOT NULL,   -- e.g. supplies | owns | works_for | blocks | refers
  to_code    TEXT NOT NULL,   -- e.g. WHO.CT-0024
  note       TEXT,            -- optional human note about this relationship
  created    TEXT NOT NULL,   -- ISO date string

  FOREIGN KEY (from_code) REFERENCES index_entries(code),
  FOREIGN KEY (to_code)   REFERENCES index_entries(code)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_from ON relationships(from_code);
CREATE INDEX idx_to   ON relationships(to_code);
```

### What SQLite is NOT used for
- Do not store full content in SQLite
- Do not store embeddings in SQLite initially (add only when hybrid search is needed)
- Do not add tables without a clear, demonstrated need

---

## Markdown File Format

Every memory entry is a markdown file with a structured frontmatter header.
The header is machine-readable. The body is human-readable.

```markdown
---
code: WHO.CT-0024
nb: WHO
type: CT
name: Erfan Tari
status: active
updated: 2026-02-19
summary: Owner, developer, ceramic specialist
---

# Erfan Tari

## Communication
- email: erfan@anatolia.com
- telegram: @erfan

## Style
- Prefers direct answers and diagrams
- Thinks architecturally before diving into detail

## Projects
- Owns WHAT.PJ-0003 (Activation X-Ray)
- Owns WHAT.PJ-0002 (meeting_local)

## Notes
- Deep interest in AI interpretability
- Building new agent platform — this one
```

### Rules for markdown files
- Frontmatter header is always present and always complete
- References to other entries always use their code (e.g. WHAT.PJ-0003)
- Never duplicate information that lives in another file — use a code reference instead
- Body content is written for a human to read, not just for the agent

---

## The Memory Query Flow

This is the most important rule in the entire system.
Follow this order strictly. Do not skip steps.

```
1. Is the code already known?
   → YES: fetch file directly by path from SQLite. Done.
   → NO: continue

2. Can SQLite answer without opening a file?
   (e.g. "show active projects" → WHERE type='PJ' AND status='active')
   → YES: query index_entries, return names + summaries. Done.
   → NO: continue

3. Can the relationship table answer it?
   (e.g. "what does WHO.CT-0025 own?" → WHERE from_code='WHO.CT-0025')
   → YES: query relationships, follow codes. Done.
   → NO: continue

4. Can index tags/names find it?
   (e.g. search name field for "Erfan")
   → YES: return match, fetch file if needed. Done.
   → NO: continue

5. Run hybrid search (BM25 + vector) — LAST RESORT ONLY
   Scope the search to the correct notebook if possible.
   Never run across all notebooks unless the query has no notebook signal.
```

---

## Heartbeat (Background Process)

The heartbeat runs every 30 minutes when the agent is idle.
It does not respond to the user. It only reads and writes to memory.

### What heartbeat checks (in order)

```
1. WHEN notebook — any events or deadlines in next 24 hours?
   → if yes: queue a user notification

2. NOW notebook — any todos overdue?
   → if yes: update status, flag in summary

3. WHY notebook — any open questions older than 3 days?
   → if yes: surface to user at next interaction

4. PLAN notebook — any planning entries needing calibration?
   → compare estimated vs actual time on completed tasks
   → update accuracy score

5. WHAT notebook — any active projects with no update in 7 days?
   → flag as stale, queue check-in question
```

### Rules for heartbeat
- Never modifies user-facing responses during a heartbeat run
- Writes findings to WHY.MT entries (meta reflections)
- Queues questions for the user — never interrupts
- If nothing needs action: does nothing, leaves no trace

---

## Skills System

Skills are loaded lazily. The full skill list is NOT injected into every prompt.

### How skills are loaded

```
Query arrives
→ Agent classifies intent (takes <100ms with small local model or simple rules)
→ Loads only skills relevant to that intent
→ Injects only those skill descriptions into the prompt

"hello"            → no skills loaded
"search the web"   → load: web_search only
"read this file"   → load: file_read only
"update project"   → load: memory_write only
```

### Required skills (build in this order)

1. `memory_read` — fetch entries by code or query SQLite
2. `memory_write` — create or update entries + SQLite index
3. `web_search` — search the web (scoped, not default)
4. `file_read` — read files from the user's system
5. `file_write` — write files to the user's system
6. `run_code` — execute scripts

Do not build more until these six work correctly.

---

## Build Order

Build in this sequence. Do not jump ahead.
Each phase must work cleanly before the next begins.

### Phase 1 — Memory Foundation
- SQLite setup with both tables and all indexes
- Code generator (sequential, never reuse)
- Markdown file writer with frontmatter
- Basic fetch by code (direct path lookup)
- Basic SQLite query (index_entries filter)

**Done when:** agent can create a contact entry, store it, and retrieve it by code in under 50ms.

### Phase 2 — Relationships
- Relationship writer (add rows to relationships table)
- Relationship reader (query by from_code or to_code)
- Bidirectional traversal (follow a chain of relationships)

**Done when:** agent can answer "what does WHO.CT-0024 own?" using only the relationships table, no file reads.

### Phase 3 — Agent Core Loop
- Receive message
- Classify intent
- Follow memory query flow (5 steps above, in order)
- Load only relevant skills
- Call LLM with lean context
- Write any new memory entries
- Return response

**Done when:** simple queries ("what's the status of project Xray?") resolve in under 2 seconds with no hybrid search triggered.

### Phase 4 — Hybrid Search
- BM25 keyword search over markdown content
- Embedding model integration (local, via LM Studio or Ollama)
- Vector storage in SQLite (add chunks table)
- Merge BM25 + vector results
- Scoped search (notebook-level, not global)

**Done when:** vague queries ("find the ceramic color work") return correct results without the agent knowing the code in advance.

### Phase 5 — Heartbeat
- Background timer (30 min interval)
- Five notebook checks (as listed above)
- Notification queue
- Planning calibration logic

**Done when:** agent proactively surfaces a deadline or stale project without being asked.

### Phase 6 — Procedures Notebook
- HOW.PR entries for recurring agent behaviors
- Agent reads relevant procedure before acting on known task types
- Agent updates procedures based on user feedback

**Done when:** agent handles a recurring task type (e.g. "update project status") by following a stored procedure, not guessing.

---

## What NOT to Build (Yet)

Do not build these until Phases 1-3 are solid:

- Multi-agent routing
- Web UI (use terminal or Telegram to start)
- Image or media handling
- Spatial/location memory (WHERE notebook)
- Cross-device sync
- Any cloud dependency

If scope creep appears — stop. Return to this file.

---

## LLM Configuration

- Default: local model via LM Studio or Ollama (OpenAI-compatible API)
- Fallback: Claude API (claude-sonnet-4-6) for complex reasoning tasks
- Embedding model: small local model for vectors (nomic-embed-text or similar)
- Never send full memory to LLM — only the entries the query flow resolved

### Context window discipline

```
What goes into every prompt:
- System prompt (lean, no skill list unless needed)
- Master index summary (just notebook names + entry counts)
- Resolved memory entries for this query (1-4 entries max for simple queries)
- Conversation history (last 6 turns only)
- Relevant skills (only those needed)

What never goes into a prompt:
- Full notebook contents
- All todos
- All projects
- Unrelated memory
- Search results beyond top 3
```

---

## Code Style and Standards

- Language: TypeScript
- Runtime: Node.js
- Database: better-sqlite3 (synchronous, simple, no async complexity)
- No ORM — write SQL directly, it is readable and debuggable
- No unnecessary abstractions in Phase 1-3
- Every function does one thing
- Every file has a clear single responsibility

---

## Testing Each Phase

Before marking a phase complete, verify:

**Phase 1:**
```
create entry → WHO.CT-0001 written to SQLite and markdown
fetch WHO.CT-0001 → returns correct file path
query "active contacts" → returns list with summaries
total time → under 50ms
```

**Phase 2:**
```
add relationship WHO.CT-0001 owns WHAT.PJ-0001
query "what does WHO.CT-0001 own?" → returns WHAT.PJ-0001 from table only
no file reads triggered
```

**Phase 3:**
```
send "what is the status of project Xray?"
→ memory query flow completes
→ SQLite answers without search
→ LLM receives lean context (< 500 tokens)
→ response returns in under 2 seconds
```

**Phase 4:**
```
send "find the work I did on ceramic colors"
→ hybrid search runs (scoped to WHAT notebook)
→ correct entry returned
→ no hallucination
```

**Phase 5:**
```
create a deadline for tomorrow
wait for heartbeat cycle
→ notification queued without being asked
```

---

## What Good Looks Like

When this is working correctly:

- A "hello" message triggers zero memory reads, zero searches, responds in under 1 second
- A known project status query reads one SQLite row and one markdown file
- A vague query triggers scoped hybrid search in one notebook only
- The agent surfaces a forgotten deadline before the user asks
- A contact entry contains enough relationship context to navigate a business network
- The LLM receives a context window that would fit comfortably in 2000 tokens for most queries

If any of these are failing — stop adding features and fix the foundation.
